# Sphere Wallet User Manual

Sphere is the official wallet and application for the Unicity ecosystem. It lets you create and manage a Unicity wallet, send and receive tokens on both the L1 (ALPHA blockchain) and L3 (Unicity state transition network), chat with other users via encrypted direct messages and group chats, interact with AI-powered marketplace agents, and connect to external dApps.

## Getting Started

### Creating a New Wallet

1. Open Sphere and click **Create New Wallet** on the welcome screen.
2. You will be asked to choose a **Unicity ID** (also called a nametag). This is a human-readable username (like `@alice`) that other users can use to send you tokens or messages. Enter a name and wait for the availability check (a green checkmark means it's available). You can also skip this step and register a nametag later.
3. Your wallet is created. A 12-word **recovery phrase** (seed phrase) is generated — **back this up immediately** and store it in a safe place. Anyone with this phrase can restore your wallet and access your funds.
4. You're now on the main dashboard with your wallet ready to use.

### Restoring a Wallet

If you already have a Unicity wallet, you can restore it:

- **From Recovery Phrase**: Click **Restore Wallet**, choose **Recovery Phrase**, and enter your 12-word seed phrase. If your wallet had multiple addresses, you'll be shown an address selection screen where you can choose which addresses to import.
- **From File**: Click **Restore Wallet**, choose **Import from File**, and upload a `.json`, `.dat`, or `.txt` wallet backup file. If the file is encrypted, you'll be prompted for the password.

After restoring, you can register a new Unicity ID or keep an existing one if it was recovered.

## Wallet Overview

The wallet panel is always visible on the right side of the screen (desktop) or accessible via the **Wallet** tab (mobile).

### Balance Display

At the top of the wallet panel you see your total portfolio balance in USD. Click the **eye icon** to hide or show your balances (this preference is remembered).

### Your Identity

The **address selector** at the top of the wallet panel shows your current Unicity ID and address. Click it to:
- **Copy** your address to the clipboard.
- **Switch** between multiple addresses if you have derived more than one.
- **Create a new address** by clicking the **New** button — this derives the next HD address and optionally lets you assign a Unicity ID to it.

If you haven't registered a Unicity ID yet, a **Register ID** button appears in the wallet header. Click it to choose and mint a nametag on-chain.

### Action Buttons

Below your balance are three action buttons:
- **Top Up** — Get tokens from the testnet faucet or create a payment request.
- **Swap** — Exchange one token type for another (e.g., UCT to USDU).
- **Send** — Send L3 tokens to another user.

### Assets and Tokens Tabs

Two tabs let you view your holdings in different ways:
- **Assets** — Groups your tokens by coin type (e.g., all UCT tokens combined). Shows the total amount, USD value, and 24-hour price change for each asset. Your L1 ALPHA balance also appears here when you have one.
- **Tokens** — Shows individual token units, sorted by newest first.

## Sending Tokens (L3)

1. Click **Send** in the wallet panel.
2. **Enter recipient**: Type a Unicity ID (like `@bob`) or toggle to "Direct Address" mode and paste a `DIRECT://...` address. The recipient is validated in real time.
3. **Select asset**: Choose which token type to send from your available assets.
4. **Enter amount**: Type the amount to send. Click **MAX** to send your entire balance of that token. Optionally add a memo message.
5. **Confirm**: Review the summary showing amount, asset, and recipient. Click **Confirm & Send**.
6. Wait for the transaction to be processed. You'll see a success confirmation when complete.

Sphere uses "smart transfer" — it automatically splits tokens if needed to send the exact amount you specified.

## Receiving Tokens (L3)

Tokens sent to your Unicity ID or direct address arrive automatically. When you receive tokens:
- A notification appears in the wallet panel.
- The new tokens animate into your asset/token list.
- The transfer shows up in your transaction history.

To receive tokens, share your **Unicity ID** (e.g., `@alice`) or your **Direct Address** with the sender. You can find and copy these from the address selector dropdown or from **Settings > My Public Keys**.

## Payment Requests

### Sending a Payment Request

You can ask someone to pay you a specific amount:
1. Go to **Top Up > Payment Request** or use the payment request feature in an agent chat.
2. Enter the recipient's Unicity ID or address.
3. Select the coin and enter the amount.
4. Optionally add a message explaining what the payment is for.
5. Click **Send Request**. The recipient will be notified.

### Receiving a Payment Request

When someone sends you a payment request:
- A **red badge** appears on the bell icon in the wallet header.
- The payment request modal opens showing the request details: who sent it, the amount, and any message.
- Click **Pay Now** to send the requested amount immediately, or **Decline** to reject the request.
- Processed requests (paid or declined) can be cleared from the history.

## Swapping Tokens

1. Click **Swap** in the wallet panel.
2. Select the token you want to swap **from** and enter the amount.
3. Select the token you want to swap **to**.
4. The exchange rate is displayed live.
5. Click **Swap Tokens** to execute the trade.

Supported coins for swapping include UCT, USDU, BTC, ETH, SOL, USDT, and USDC.

## Top Up (Testnet Faucet)

On testnet, you can get free tokens:
1. Click **Top Up** in the wallet panel.
2. On the **Faucet** tab, click **Request All Coins**.
3. You'll receive a set of test tokens in various denominations.

Note: You must have a registered Unicity ID to use the faucet.

## L1 Wallet (ALPHA Blockchain)

Sphere includes a built-in L1 wallet for the ALPHA blockchain. Access it from **Settings > L1 Wallet** or by clicking the L1 ALPHA asset row in your assets list.

### Viewing Your L1 Balance

The L1 wallet shows your total ALPHA balance, broken down into:
- **Vested** — ALPHA that is fully available to spend.
- **Unvested** — ALPHA from coinbase rewards that is still in the vesting period.

### Sending ALPHA (L1)

1. In the L1 wallet, click **Send ALPHA**.
2. Enter the destination address (`alpha1...` format) or a Unicity ID.
3. Enter the amount and review the fee estimate.
4. Confirm and send.

### Receiving ALPHA (L1)

Click the **Receive** button in the L1 wallet to display a **QR code** of your L1 address. Share this QR code or your `alpha1...` address with the sender.

### L1 Transaction History

Click the **Transaction History** button in the L1 wallet to see your L1 transactions. Each entry shows:
- Whether it was sent or received.
- The amount in ALPHA.
- A clickable transaction ID that opens in the Unicity block explorer.
- Confirmation count.

### Multiple L1 Addresses

You can derive additional L1 addresses from the address dropdown in the L1 wallet. Each address is linked to the same HD wallet and shares the same recovery phrase.

## Direct Messages (DM Chat)

Sphere includes end-to-end encrypted direct messaging built on the Nostr protocol (NIP-17).

### Starting a Conversation

1. Select the **Chat** agent from the agent grid.
2. Click the **+** button (new conversation) in the sidebar.
3. Enter the recipient's Unicity ID or public key.
4. Start typing your message in the input field and press Enter or click Send.

### Chat Features

- **Conversation list**: The left sidebar shows all your conversations, sorted by most recent. A search bar lets you filter by nametag.
- **Typing indicator**: Shows when the other person is typing.
- **Message history**: Scroll up to load older messages.
- **@mentions**: Click on an @mention in a message to open a new DM with that user.
- **Fullscreen mode**: Click the expand icon to make the chat take up the full screen. Press Escape to exit.

### Mini Chat Bubbles (Desktop)

On desktop, a floating chat icon appears in the bottom-left corner of the screen on all pages. It shows:
- An unread message count badge.
- Up to 5 conversation bubbles for your most recent chats.
- Click a bubble to open a mini chat window without leaving your current page.

## Group Chat

Sphere supports group messaging through NIP-29 relay-based groups.

### Joining a Group

1. In the Chat section, switch to the **Global** tab using the mode toggle.
2. Click **Browse Groups** to see available groups.
3. Click **Join** on any group you want to participate in.
4. You can also join a group via an invite link shared by someone else.

### Group Chat Features

- **Member list**: Click the member count in the group header to see all members.
- **Reply to messages**: Hover over a message and click the reply button to create a threaded reply.
- **@mentions**: Mention other group members; clicking a mention opens a DM with them.
- **Moderation**: Group admins and moderators can delete messages and kick members.
- **Leave group**: Right-click or use the menu on a group in the sidebar to leave.

### Creating a Group

Group creation is available to relay administrators. Click **Create Group**, enter a name and description, and the group is created on the relay.

## IPFS Sync

Sphere can sync your token data to IPFS for backup and cross-device access.

- The **cloud icon** in the header shows your IPFS sync status:
  - **Green cloud**: Synced successfully.
  - **Orange spinner**: Sync in progress.
  - **Gray cloud-off**: IPFS sync is disabled.
  - **Red dot**: Sync error (hover for details).
- **Click the icon** to toggle IPFS sync on or off. This preference persists across sessions.

When enabled, your token data is automatically synced to IPFS after changes. When you restore a wallet on a new device, your tokens can be recovered from IPFS.

## Settings

Access settings by clicking the **three-dot menu** icon in the wallet header.

### L1 Wallet

Opens the full L1 (ALPHA blockchain) wallet interface (described above).

### My Public Keys

Displays all your identity keys and addresses:
- **Unicity ID** (`@nametag`)
- **Direct Address** (`DIRECT://...`) — your L3 address for receiving tokens
- **Proxy Address** — alternative L3 address format
- **L1 Address** (`alpha1...`) — your ALPHA blockchain address
- **Chain Pubkey** — 33-byte compressed secp256k1 public key
- **Transport Pubkey** — Nostr transport key for messaging

Each field has a copy button. There is also a **Lookup** feature where you can search for any user by their Unicity ID, direct address, or L1 address to see all their associated addresses.

### Backup Wallet

Two backup options:
- **Export Wallet File** — Downloads an encrypted JSON file of your wallet. You can set a password for encryption.
- **Show Recovery Phrase** — Displays your 12-word seed phrase. Write this down and store it securely.

### Logout

Logging out deletes all wallet data from your browser. You will be prompted to backup first:
- **Backup & Logout** — Opens the backup screen before clearing data.
- **Logout Without Backup** — Immediately clears all data. Make sure you have your recovery phrase saved before using this option.

## dApp Connect

External applications can connect to your Sphere wallet through the dApp Connect feature.

When an external dApp requests a connection:
1. A popup window opens showing the dApp's name and the permissions it is requesting.
2. Click **Approve** to allow the connection or **Deny** to reject it.
3. Once connected, the dApp can request transactions (sends, payment requests) which open pre-filled in your wallet for your confirmation.

Approved connections are remembered per website so you won't be prompted again for the same dApp.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Back up your recovery phrase** immediately after creating a wallet. Store it offline in a secure location. Never share it with anyone.
- **Register a Unicity ID** to make it easy for others to send you tokens and messages. It's much easier to share `@alice` than a long address.
- **Enable IPFS sync** to back up your token data across devices.
- **Use the address selector** if you need separate addresses for different purposes — each derived address can have its own Unicity ID.
- **Check payment requests** regularly — the red bell badge indicates pending requests that need your attention.
- **Export a wallet backup** periodically, especially before logging out or clearing browser data.
